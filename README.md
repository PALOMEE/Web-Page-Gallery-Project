# Web-Photo-Gallery-Project
OVERVIEW: In this project, I have developed of a JavaScript and CSS-based web photo gallery featuring a set of thumbnails positioned at the top and a main preview image below. The gallery dynamically updates the main preview image when the user hovers over the thumbnails, enhancing the user experience and interactivity of the website.
